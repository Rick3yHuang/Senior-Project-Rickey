	abstract = {At the turn of the twentieth century, American museums helped to legitimize archaeology as a scientific discipline. By the next century, repatriation legislation had forced archaeologists to confront the dehumanization that can take place when bodies and sacred objects are treated as scientific specimens. Charting the future(s) of archaeology-museum relationships requires us to (1) recognize where, when, and how harm has been done, (2) confront those harmful precedents, and (3) restructure collections and exhibits in ways that heal wounds and advance research. Current research on the 1916 Susquehanna River Expedition, an archaeology-museum project funded by George Gustav Heye, provides insight into how our predecessors viewed their work. Using the expedition project as backdrop, an archaeology professor and an undergraduate student engage in a dialogue that explores the changing roles of American museums as the public faces of archaeology, training grounds for young professionals, and cultural centers for us all. * KEYWORDS: expeditions, history of archaeology, NAGPRA, North America, repatriation, Susquehanna River},

	abstract = {In §10 of Chapter 2 we discussed some criteria designed to identify situations where it is possible to see in advance that an S-polynomial remainder will be zero in Buchberger’s algorithm. Those unnecessary S-polynomial remainder calculations are in fact the main computational bottleneck for the basic form of the algorithm. Finding ways to avoid them, or alternatively to replace them with less expensive computations, is the key to improving the efficiency of Gröbner basis calculation. The algorithms we discuss in this chapter apply several different approaches to achieve greater efficiency. Some of them use Gröbner bases of homogeneous ideals or ideas inspired by the special properties of Gröbner bases in that case. So we begin in §1 by showing that the computation of a homogeneous Gröbner basis can be organized to proceed degree by degree. This gives the framework for Traverso’s Hilbert driven Buchberger algorithm, discussed in §2, which uses the Hilbert function of a homogeneous ideal to control the computation and bypass many unnecessary S-polynomial remainder calculations. We also show in §1 that the information generated by several S-polynomial remainder computations can be obtained simultaneously via row operations on a suitable matrix. This connection with linear algebra is the basis for Faugère’s F4 algorithm presented in §3. Finally, we introduce the main ideas behind signature-based Gröbner basis algorithms, including Faugère’s F5 algorithm, in §4.},

Providing more than enough material for a one-semester course, Combinatorics of Permutations, Second Edition continues to clearly show the usefulness of this subject for both students and researchers and is recommended for undergraduate libraries by the MAA.  Expanded ChaptersMuch of the book has been significantly revised and extended. This edition includes a new section on alternating permutations and new material on multivariate applications of the exponential formula. It also discusses several important results in pattern avoidance as well as the concept of asymptotically normal distributions. New ChapterAn entirely new chapter focuses on three sorting algorithms from molecular biology. This emerging area of combinatorics is known for its easily stated and extremely difficult problems, which sometimes can be solved using deep techniques from seemingly remote branches of mathematics.  Additional Exercises and ProblemsAll chapters in the second edition have more exercises and problems. Exercises are marked according to level of difficulty and many of the problems encompass results from the last eight years.},

	abstract = {This text covers topics in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra with a strong perspective toward practical and computational aspects. The first four chapters form the core of the book. A comprehensive chart in the Preface illustrates a variety of ways to proceed with the material once these chapters are covered. In addition to the fundamentals of algebraic geometry—the elimination theorem, the extension theorem, the closure theorem and the Nullstellensatz—this new edition incorporates several substantial changes, all of which are listed in the Preface. The largest revision incorporates a new Chapter (ten), which presents some of the essentials of progress made over the last decades in computing Gröbner bases. The book also includes current computer algebra material in Appendix C and updated independent projects (Appendix D).The book may serve as a first or second course in undergraduate abstract algebra and with some supplementation perhaps, for beginning graduate level courses in algebraic geometry or computational algebra. Prerequisites for the reader include linear algebra and a proof-oriented course. It is assumed that the reader has access to a computer algebra system. Appendix C describes features of Maple™, Mathematica® and Sage, as well as other systems that are most relevant to the text. Pseudocode is used in the text; Appendix B carefully describes the pseudocode used.Readers who are teaching from Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms, or are studying the book on their own, may obtain a copy of the solutions manual by sending an email to jlittle@holycross.edu.From the reviews of previous editions: “…The book gives an introduction to Buchberger’s algorithm with applications to syzygies, Hilbert polynomials, primary decompositions. There is an introduction to classical algebraic geometry with applications to the ideal membership problem, solving polynomial equations and elimination theory. …The book is well-written. …The reviewer is sure that it will be an excellent guide to introduce further undergraduates in the algorithmic aspect of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.” —Peter Schenzel, zbMATH, 2007 “I consider the book to be wonderful. ... The exposition is very clear, there are many helpful pictures and there are a great many instructive exercises, some quite challenging ... offers the heart and soul of modern commutative and algebraic geometry.” —The American Mathematical Monthly},

Comparing the two samples of college students, we hypothesized continued differences by religion and religiosity as found in the earlier survey, but we also expected that these differences would have diminished over time with a convergence of attitudes on methods which have become increasingly widely practiced. Findings confirmed that, as in 1984, Jews were more approving of most methods than were Protestants and Catholics, and the more religious subjects were the least approving. This was true of methods included in the prior survey (e.g. artificial insemination by husband and donor,in vitro fertilization, and surrogacy) as well as of newer methods developed since then (e.g. ovum donation, cloning). The comparison revealed no evidence of convergence, despite declining religiosity; religious identification persists as a powerful influence on attitudes. Yet the majority of students claimed that their religious background and upbringing had no effect on their opinions.},

It has caused major social changes in various areas, such as the suburbanization of Jews, women's increased learning, and the possibility of participating in worldwide community activities. From a socio-halakhic viewpoint, technology influences Jews' choice of residence, has socialized and politicized kashrut certification, and has changed modes of Jewish study. The development of new technologies has brought with it many halakhic challenges and decisions, on Shabbat observance among other things. Technology may also stimulate better observance of the commandments. It influences Jewish thinking and is leading to new ways of presenting ancient concepts. From a philosophical viewpoint, Judaism proposes a way of life that is not subordinated to technology, unlike life in general society. This is mainly expressed in the domain of holiness. Developing a more detailed analysis of the interaction between technology and Jewish life will open new horizons for learning, studying, thinking, research, determining halakha, and making practical decisions.},

	abstract = {Small Pacific islands, especially atolls, have been widely argued to be in the forefront of climate change. Recent degradation of island environments has primarily been attributed to the impact of sea-level rise. However, physical changes to several small islands can be linked to a range of physical influences and to human modification. La Niña events, cyclones, and wind waves have caused localized flooding and storm damage. Most atoll islands have not significantly changed in size, as deposition balances erosion. Many islands have experienced broadly similar environmental problems in earlier times, at different scales, and over different time periods, now accentuated by human pressures on scarce land areas and resources. Local human factors (including construction and mining), tectonic subsidence, and La Niña events have created some iconic sites that have become symbols of sea-level rise, sometimes erroneously attributed solely to global warming. Limited economic prospects in most small islands, rising expectations, and growing populations have contributed to a culture of migration, marked by international migration and urbanization, that has diversified impoverished livelihoods, extended island geographies, and resulted in accentuated population concentrations. Contemporary climate change exacerbates present environmental changes, stimulates further migration, and points to diasporic futures.},

	abstract = {This conversation among the editors of ARIEL and Timothy Clark addresses his 2012 essay, “Derangements of Scale,” published in Telemorphosis: Theory in the Era of Climate Change. In his essay, Clark suggests that scale effects play an important role in contemporary global politics and climate change, and he proposes a new, larger scale of literary study commensurate with an awareness of these issues. The editors discuss the implications of Clark’s essay for postcolonial studies, the merits of his proposed method of literary interpretation, and the ramifications of his discussion of human agency. Clark takes up all of these issues in his response to the editors’ conversation.},
